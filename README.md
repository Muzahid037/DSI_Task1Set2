# Problem Description

You want to keep track of the students that you teach. You are cringingly self-conscious
about your productivity. So, you need to keep a ledger for all the information about these
students. When you run the program, it will be able to accept command line inputs. And,
will show the result in the command line. When engaging with the command line, it will
give you options to:  

## 1. Add a student
**a.** There will be 3 classes. Class 8, 9, or 10. You will have to choose one.  
**b.** It should have this information  
    __i.__ Name  
    __ii.__ A list of booleans of what subjects you teach. Math, English, Or Bangla  
    __iii.__ Average of marks s/he get in the exam. (Will be 0 by default at first)  
    __iv.__ Total days taught (Will be 0 by default at first)  
    __v.__ Total earnings (Will be 0 by default at first)  

## 2. Edit a student  
**a.** Adding days to the number of days taught. For every subject per day, you get BDT 1.  
**b.** Adding marks in exam s/he gets as an integer from 0 to 100. These marks will change the average.  

## 3. Delete a student  
**a.** When a student is deleted, it will not show in the list but the earnings added because of him/her will still be there in total earning.  

## 4. See the list of students individually  
**a.** If you choose a specific class, the list will include the name of the students, total earnings, average marks. Showing these in a tabular form is not mandatory. But, anyone would love that, right?  
**b.** You can pick one and see the full details.  

## 5. See overall info  
**a.** The total days taught across all classes  
**b.** Individual days taught in each class  
**c.** Total earnings  
**d.** Individual earnings of each class  
**e.** Individual earnings of each subject  
**f.** Average marks of all students  

After creating the application, assume you have nothing at the moment. Then add 10
students. Edit some of them so that the overall info can be produced visibly.
